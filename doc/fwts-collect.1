.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fwts-collect
.RI [ FILES ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B fwts-collect
firmware test suite log collecting tool.
The tool
.B fwts-collect
collects logs and various system and firmware dumps into the gzip'd tar ball
fwts-logs.tar.gz which can then be added to bug reports.  It collects data
from /proc/iomem, /proc/mtrr, /proc/interrupts, IRQ counts from 
/sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts and kernel logs.  It also invokes fwts and
gathers ACPI tables, memorymaps, MultiProcessor table dumps, CMOS data,
UEFI variables, EBDA region, kernel version and ACPI version information. 
.B
fwts
using sudo is required.
.br
Running
.B
fwts
with no options will collect logs automatically. However, one can also
specify the names of addition files to be added to the gzip'd tar ball.
