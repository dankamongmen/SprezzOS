 <title>Shutting down the system</title>

<para>

To shut down a running &debian-gnu; system, you must not reboot with the
reset switch on the front or back of your computer, or just turn off
the computer.  &debian-gnu; should be shut down in a controlled manner,
otherwise files might get lost and/or disk damage might occur. If you run a
desktop environment, there is usually an option to <quote>log out</quote>
available from the application menu that allows you to shutdown (or reboot)
the system.

Alternatively you can press the key combination <keycombo>
<keycap>Ctrl</keycap> <keycap>Alt</keycap> <keycap>Del</keycap> </keycombo>
<phrase arch="powerpc"> or <keycombo> <keycap>Control</keycap>
<keycap>Shift</keycap> <keycap>Power</keycap> </keycombo> on Macintosh
systems</phrase>. A last option is to log in as root and type one of the
commands <command>poweroff</command>, <command>halt</command> or
<command>shutdown -h now</command> if either of the key combinations do not
work or you prefer to type commands; use <command>reboot</command> to reboot
the system.
