 <title>What is &debian; GNU/Hurd?</title>

<para>

&debian; GNU/Hurd is a &debian; GNU system with the GNU Hurd &mdash; a set of
servers running on top of the GNU Mach microkernel.

</para><para>

The Hurd is still unfinished, and is
unsuitable for day-to-day use, but work is continuing.  The Hurd is
currently only being developed for the i386 architecture, although
ports to other architectures will be made once the system becomes more
stable.

Please note that &debian; GNU/Hurd is not a Linux system, and thus some
information on Linux system may not apply to it.
