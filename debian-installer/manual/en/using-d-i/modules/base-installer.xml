During installation of the base system, package unpacking and setup
messages are redirected to <userinput>tty4</userinput>.
You can access this terminal by pressing
<keycombo><keycap>Left Alt</keycap><keycap>F4</keycap></keycombo>;
get back to the main installer process with
<keycombo><keycap>Left Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>.

The unpack/setup messages generated during this phase are also saved in
<filename>/var/log/syslog</filename>. You can check them there if the
installation is performed over a serial console.

As part of the installation, a &arch-kernel; kernel will be installed. At the default
priority, the installer will choose one for you that best matches your
hardware. In lower priority modes, you will be able to choose from a list
of available kernels.

When packages are installed using the package management system, it will
by default also install packages that are recommended by those packages.
Recommended packages are not strictly required for the core functionality
of the selected software, but they do enhance that software and should,
in the view of the package maintainers, normally be installed together
with that software.

For technical reasons packages installed during the installation of the
base system are installed without their <quote>Recommends</quote>. The
rule described above only takes effect after this point in the installation
process.
