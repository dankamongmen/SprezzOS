  <title>Check available memory / low memory mode</title>

<para>

One of the first things &d-i; does, is to check available memory.
If the available memory is limited, this component will make some
changes in the installation process which hopefully will allow
you to install &debian-gnu; on your system.

</para><para>

The first measure taken to reduce memory consumption by the installer
is to disable translations, which means that the installation can
only be done in English. Of course, you can still localize the installed
system after the installation has completed.

</para><para>

If that is not sufficient, the installer will further reduce memory
consumption by loading only those components essential to complete a basic
installation. This reduces the functionality of the installation system.
You will be given the opportunity to load additional components manually,
but you should be aware that each component you select will use
additional memory and thus may cause the installation to fail.

If the installer runs in low memory mode, it is recommended to create
a relatively large swap partition (64&ndash;128MB). The swap partition
will be used as virtual memory and thus increases the amount of memory
available to the system. The installer will activate the swap partition
as early as possible in the installation process. Note that heavy use
of swap will reduce performance of your system and may lead to high
disk activity.

</para><para>

Despite these measures, it is still possible that your system freezes,
that unexpected errors occur or that processes are killed by the kernel
because the system runs out of memory (which will result in <quote>Out
of memory</quote> messages on VT4 and in the syslog).

</para><para>

For example, it has been reported that creating a big ext3 file system
fails in low memory mode when there is insufficient swap space. If a
larger swap doesn't help, try creating the file system as ext2 (which
is an essential component of the installer) instead. It is possible to
change an ext2 partition to ext3 after the installation.

</para><para>

It is possible to force the installer to use a higher lowmem level than
the one based on available memory by using the boot parameter
<quote>lowmem</quote> as described in <xref linkend="installer-args"/>.
