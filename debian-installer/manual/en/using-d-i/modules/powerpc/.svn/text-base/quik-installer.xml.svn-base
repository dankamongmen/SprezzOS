  <title>Install <command>Quik</command> on a Hard Disk</title>
<para>

The boot loader for OldWorld Power Macintosh machines is
<command>quik</command>.  You can also use it on CHRP. The installer
will attempt to set up <command>quik</command> automatically. The
setup has been known to work on 7200, 7300, and 7600 Powermacs, and on
some Power Computing clones.
