   <title>Reboot the System</title>

<para arch="not-s390">

You will be prompted to remove the boot media (CD, floppy, etc) that you
used to boot the installer. After that the system will be rebooted into
your new &debian; system.

</para><para arch="s390">

After a final prompt the system will be halted because rebooting is not
supported on &arch-title;.
You then need to IPL &debian-gnu; from the DASD which you selected for the
root filesystem during the first steps of the installation.
