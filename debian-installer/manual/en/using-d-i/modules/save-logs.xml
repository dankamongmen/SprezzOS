   <title>Saving the installation logs</title>

<para>

If the installation is successful, the logfiles created during
the installation process will be automatically saved to
<filename>/var/log/installer/</filename> on your new
&debian; system.

</para><para>

Choosing <guimenuitem>Save debug logs</guimenuitem> from the main
menu allows you to save the log files to a floppy disk, network, hard
disk, or other media. This can be useful if you encounter fatal problems
during the installation and wish to study the logs on another system
or attach them to an installation report.
