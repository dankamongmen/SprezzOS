The installer will first attempt to connect to a time server on the
Internet (using the <firstterm>NTP</firstterm> protocol) in order to
correctly set the system time. If this does not succeed, the installer
will assume the time and date obtained from the system clock when the
installation system was booted are correct. It is not possible to manually
set the system time during the installation process.

The installer does not modify the system clock on the s390 platform.
