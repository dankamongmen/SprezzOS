When packages are installed using the package management system, it will
by default also install packages that are recommended by those packages.
Recommended packages are not strictly required for the core functionality
of the selected software, but they do enhance that software and should,
in the view of the package maintainers, normally be installed together
with that software.

For technical reasons packages installed during the installation of the
base system are installed without their <quote>Recommends</quote>. The
rule described above only takes effect after this point in the installation
process.
