   <title>Continue Without Boot Loader</title>

<para>

This option can be used to complete the installation even when no boot
loader is to be installed, either because the arch/subarch doesn't
provide one, or because none is desired (e.g. you will use existing
boot loader).

If you plan to manually configure your bootloader, you should check the
name of the installed kernel in <filename>/target/boot</filename>.
You should also check that directory for the presence of an
<firstterm>initrd</firstterm>; if one is present, you will probably have
to instruct your bootloader to use it. Other information you will need
are the disk and partition you selected for your <filename>/</filename>
filesystem and, if you chose to install <filename>/boot</filename> on a
separate partition, also your <filename>/boot</filename> filesystem.
