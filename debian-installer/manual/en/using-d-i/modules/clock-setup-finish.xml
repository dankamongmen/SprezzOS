   <title>Setting the System Clock</title>

<para>

The installer may ask you if the computer's clock is set to UTC. Normally
this question is avoided if possible and the installer tries to work out
whether the clock is set to UTC based on things like what other operating
systems are installed.

In expert mode you will always be able to choose
whether or not the clock is set to UTC.
<phrase arch="powerpc">Macintosh hardware clocks are normally
set to local time. If you want to dual-boot, select local time instead of
UTC.</phrase>
<phrase arch="any-x86">Systems that (also) run Dos or Windows are normally
set to local time. If you want to dual-boot, select local time
instead of UTC.</phrase>

</para><para>

At this point &d-i; will also attempt to save the current time to the
system's hardware clock. This will be done either in UTC or local time,
depending on the selection that was just made.
