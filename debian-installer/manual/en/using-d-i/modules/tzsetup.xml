<para>

Depending on the location selected earlier in the installation process,
you may be shown a list of time zones relevant for that location.
If your location has only one time zone and you are doing a default
installation, you will not be asked anything and the system will assume
that time zone.

</para><para>

In expert mode or when installing at medium priority, you will have the
additional option to select <quote>Coordinated Universal Time</quote> (UTC)
as time zone.

If for some reason you wish to set a time zone for the installed system
that does <emphasis>not</emphasis> match the selected location, there are
two options.

The simplest option is to just select a different time zone after the
installation has been completed and you've booted into the new system.
The command to do this is:

<informalexample><screen>
# dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
</screen></informalexample>

</para>

Alternatively, the time zone can be set at the very start of the
installation by passing the parameter
<userinput>time/zone=<replaceable>value</replaceable></userinput>
when you boot the installation system. The value should of course be a
valid time zone, for example <userinput>Europe/London</userinput> or
<userinput>UTC</userinput>.

For automated installations the time zone can be set to any desired value
using preseeding.
