&boot-installer-intro-net.xml;

<para>

On machines with OpenBoot, simply enter the boot monitor on the
machine which is being installed (see
<xref linkend="invoking-openboot"/>).
Use the command <userinput>boot net</userinput> to boot from a TFTP
and RARP server, or try <userinput>boot net:bootp</userinput> or
<userinput>boot net:dhcp</userinput> to boot from a TFTP and BOOTP
or DHCP server. You can pass extra boot parameters to &d-i; at the end
of the <userinput>boot</userinput> command.

<para>

Most OpenBoot versions support the <userinput>boot cdrom</userinput>
command which is simply an alias to boot from the SCSI device on ID 6
(or the secondary master for IDE based systems).

<quote>IDPROM</quote>, then it's possible that your NVRAM battery, which
holds configuration information for you firmware, has run out.  See the
