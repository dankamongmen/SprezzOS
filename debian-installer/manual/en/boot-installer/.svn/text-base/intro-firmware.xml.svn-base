There is an increasing number of consumer devices that directly boot from a
flash chip on the device.  The installer can be written to flash so it will
automatically start when you reboot your machines.

In many cases, changing the firmware of an embedded device voids your
warranty.  Sometimes you are also not able to recover your device if there
are problems during the flashing process.  Therefore, please take care and
follow the steps precisely.
