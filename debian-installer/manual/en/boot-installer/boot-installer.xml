If you have any other operating systems on your system that you wish to
keep (dual boot setup), you should make sure that they have been properly
shut down <emphasis>before</emphasis> you boot the installer.
Installing an operating system while another operating system is in
hibernation (has been suspended to disk) could result in loss of, or damage
to the state of the suspended operating system which could cause problems
when it is rebooted.
