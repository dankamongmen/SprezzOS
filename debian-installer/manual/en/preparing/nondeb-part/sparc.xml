  <sect2 arch="sparc"><title>Partitioning from SunOS</title>

<para>

It's perfectly fine to partition from SunOS; in fact, if you intend to
run both SunOS and &debian; on the same machine, it is recommended that
you partition using SunOS prior to installing &debian;.  The Linux
kernel understands Sun disk labels, so there are no problems there.
SILO supports booting Linux and SunOS from any of EXT2 (Linux), UFS
(SunOS), romfs or iso9660 (CDROM) partitions.

Whatever system you are using to partition, make sure you create a
<quote>Sun disk label</quote> on your boot disk.  This is the only kind of
partition scheme that the OpenBoot PROM understands, and so it's the
only scheme from which you can boot.  In <command>fdisk</command>, the
<keycap>s</keycap> key is used to create Sun disk labels. You only need to do this
on drives that do not already have a Sun disk label. If you are using a
drive that was previously formatted using a PC (or other architecture) you
must create a new disk label, or problems with the disk geometry will most
likely occur.

You will probably be using <command>SILO</command> as your boot loader (the
small program which runs the operating system kernel).
<command>SILO</command> has certain requirements for partition sizes and
location; see <xref linkend="partitioning"/>.
