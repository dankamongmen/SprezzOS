<para>

BIOS provides the basic functions needed to boot your machine to allow
your operating system to access your hardware.  Your system probably
provides a BIOS setup menu, which is used to configure the BIOS.
Before installing, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> ensure that your BIOS
is set up correctly; not doing so can lead to intermittent crashes or
an inability to install &debian;.

The rest of this section is lifted from the
<ulink url="&url-pc-hw-faq;"></ulink>, answering the question, <quote>How do I
enter the CMOS configuration menu?</quote>.  How you access the BIOS (or
<quote>CMOS</quote>) configuration menu depends on who wrote your BIOS
software:

Some &arch-title; machines don't have a CMOS configuration menu in the
BIOS.  They require a software CMOS setup program.  If you don't have
the Installation and/or Diagnostics diskette for your machine, you can
try using a shareware/freeware program.  Try looking in
<ulink url="&url-simtel;"></ulink>.

  <sect2 arch="any-x86" id="boot-dev-select"><title>Boot Device Selection</title>

<para>

Many BIOS setup menus allow you to select the devices that will be
used to bootstrap the system. Set this to look for a bootable
operating system on <filename>A:</filename> (the first floppy disk),
then optionally the first CD-ROM device (possibly appearing as
<filename>D:</filename> or <filename>E:</filename>), and then from
<filename>C:</filename> (the first hard disk).  This setting enables
you to boot from either a floppy disk or a CD-ROM, which are the two
most common boot devices used to install &debian;.

</para><para>

If you have a newer SCSI controller and you have a CD-ROM device
attached to it, you are usually able to boot from the CD-ROM.  All you
have to do is enable booting from a CD-ROM in the SCSI-BIOS of your
controller.

</para><para>

Another popular option is to boot from a USB storage device (also called
a USB memory stick or USB key). Some BIOSes can boot directly from a USB
storage device, but some cannot. You may need to configure your BIOS to boot
from a <quote>Removable drive</quote> or even from <quote>USB-ZIP</quote> to
get it to boot from the USB device.

</para><para>

Here are some details about how to set the boot order. Remember to
reset the boot order after &arch-kernel; is installed, so that you restart
your machine from the hard drive.

<para>

Some BIOS systems (such as Award BIOS) allow you to automatically set
the CD speed.  You should avoid that, and instead set it to, say, the
lowest speed.  If you get <userinput>seek failed</userinput> error
messages, this may be your problem.

   <sect3><title>Extended vs. Expanded Memory</title>
<para>

If your system provides both ex<emphasis>ten</emphasis>ded and
ex<emphasis>pan</emphasis>ded memory, set it so that there is as much
extended and as little expanded memory as possible. &arch-kernel; requires
extended memory and cannot use expanded memory.

</para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Virus Protection</title>
<para>

Disable any virus-warning features your BIOS may provide. If you have
a virus-protection board or other special hardware, make sure it is
disabled or physically removed while running GNU/&arch-kernel;. These aren't
compatible with GNU/&arch-kernel;; moreover, due to the file system
permissions and protected memory of the &arch-kernel; kernel, viruses are
almost unheard of<footnote>
<para>

After installation you can enable Boot Sector protection if you
want. This offers no additional security in &arch-kernel; but if you also run
Windows it may prevent a catastrophe. There is no need to tamper with
the Master Boot Record (MBR) after the boot manager has been set up.

Your motherboard may provide <emphasis>shadow RAM</emphasis> or BIOS
caching. You may see settings for <quote>Video BIOS Shadow</quote>,
<quote>C800-CBFF Shadow</quote>, etc. <emphasis>Disable</emphasis>
all shadow RAM.  Shadow
RAM is used to accelerate access to the ROMs on your motherboard and
on some of the controller cards. &arch-kernel; does not use these ROMs once it
has booted because it provides its own faster 32-bit software in place
of the 16-bit programs in the ROMs. Disabling the shadow RAM may make
some of it available for programs to use as normal memory.  Leaving
the shadow RAM enabled may interfere with &arch-kernel; access to hardware
devices.

   <sect3><title>Memory Hole</title>
<para>

If your BIOS offers something like <quote>15&ndash;16 MB Memory
Hole</quote>, please disable that. &arch-kernel; expects to find memory there if
you have that much RAM.

</para><para>

We have a report of an Intel Endeavor motherboard on which there is an
option called <quote>LFB</quote> or <quote>Linear Frame Buffer</quote>.
This had two settings: <quote>Disabled</quote> and <quote>1
Megabyte</quote>. Set it to <quote>1 Megabyte</quote>.
When disabled, the installation floppy was not read correctly, and the
system eventually crashed. At this writing we don't understand what's
going on with this particular device &mdash; it just worked with that
setting and not without it.

   <sect3><title>Advanced Power Management</title>
<para>

If your motherboard provides Advanced Power Management (APM),
configure it so that power management is controlled by APM. Disable
the doze, standby, suspend, nap, and sleep modes, and disable the hard
disk's power-down timer.  &arch-kernel; can take over control of these modes,
and can do a better job of power-management than the BIOS.
