Almost any network interface card (NIC) supported by the &arch-kernel; kernel
should also be supported by the installation system; modular drivers
should normally be loaded automatically.

<phrase arch="x86">This includes most PCI and PCMCIA cards.</phrase>
<phrase arch="i386">Many older ISA cards are supported as well.</phrase>

This includes a lot of generic PCI cards (for systems that have PCI) and
the following NICs from Sun:

ISDN is supported, but not during the installation.

  <title>Wireless Network Cards</title>
<para>

Wireless networking is in general supported as well and a growing number of
wireless adapters are supported by the official &arch-kernel; kernel, although many
of them do require firmware to be loaded. If firmware is needed, the installer
will prompt you to load firmware. See <xref linkend="loading-firmware"/>
for detailed information on how to load firmware during the installation.

</para><para>

Wireless NICs that are not supported by the official &arch-kernel; kernel can generally
be made to work under &debian-gnu;, but are not supported during the installation.

</para><para>

If there is a problem with wireless and there
is no other NIC you can use during the installation, it is still
possible to install &debian-gnu; using a full CD-ROM or DVD image. Select the
option to not configure a network and install using only the packages
available from the CD/DVD. You can then install the driver and firmware you
need after the installation is completed (after the reboot) and configure
your network manually.

</para><para>

In some cases the driver you need may not be available as a &debian; package.
You will then have to look if there is source code available in the internet
and compile the driver yourself. How to do this is outside the scope of this
manual.
<phrase arch="x86">If no Linux driver is available, your last resort is to
use the <classname>ndiswrapper</classname> package, which allows you to use
a Windows driver.</phrase>

  <title>Known Issues for &arch-title;</title>
<para>

There are a couple of issues with specific network cards that are worth
mentioning here.

</para>

   <sect4><title>Conflict between tulip and dfme drivers</title>
<!-- BTS: #334104; may also affect other arches, but most common on sparc -->
<para>

<!-- BTS: #334104; may also affect other arches, but most common on sparc -->
There are various PCI network cards that have the same PCI identification,
but are supported by related, but different drivers. Some cards work with
the <literal>tulip</literal> driver, others with the <literal>dfme</literal>
driver. Because they have the same identification, the kernel cannot
distinguish between them and it is not certain which driver will be loaded.
If this happens to be the wrong one, the NIC may not work, or work badly.

</para><para>

This is a common problem on Netra systems with a Davicom (DEC-Tulip
compatible) NIC. In that case the <literal>tulip</literal> driver is
probably the correct one.
You can prevent this issue by blacklisting the wrong driver module as
described in <xref linkend="module-blacklist"/>.

</para><para>

An alternative solution during the installation is to switch to a shell
and unload the wrong driver module using
<userinput>modprobe -r <replaceable>module</replaceable></userinput> (or
both, if they are both loaded). After that you can load the correct module
using <userinput>modprobe <replaceable>module</replaceable></userinput>.
Note that the wrong module may then still be loaded when the system is
rebooted.
