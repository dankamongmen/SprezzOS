Sparc-based hardware is divided into a number of different subarchitectures,
identified by one of the following names: sun4, sun4c, sun4d, sun4m, sun4u
or sun4v. The following list describes what machines they include and what
level of support may be expected for each of them.

None of these 32-bit sparc subarchitectures (sparc32) is supported. For a
complete list of machines belonging to these subarchitectures, please consult
the <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation">Wikipedia
SPARCstation page</ulink>.

</para><para>

The last &debian; release to support sparc32 was Etch, but even then only
for sun4m systems. Support for the other 32-bits subarchitectures had
already been discontinued after earlier releases.

<listitem><para>

This subarchitecture includes all 64-bit machines (sparc64) based on
the UltraSparc processor and its clones. Most of the machines are well
supported, even though for some you may experience problems booting from
CD due to firmware or bootloader bugs (this problem may be worked around
by using netbooting). Use the sparc64 or sparc64-smp kernel in UP and SMP
configurations respectively.

<term>sun4v</term>

<listitem><para>

This is the newest addition to the Sparc family, which includes machines
based on the Niagara multi-core CPUs. At the moment such CPUs are only
available in T1000 and T2000 servers by Sun, and are well supported. Use
the sparc64-smp kernel.

Note that Fujitsu's SPARC64 CPUs used in PRIMEPOWER family of servers are not
supported due to lack of support in the Linux kernel.
