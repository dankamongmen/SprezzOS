<para>

Each distinct ARM architecture requires its own kernel. Because of
this the standard &debian; distribution only supports installation on
a number of the most common platforms. The &debian; userland however may be
used by <emphasis>any</emphasis> ARM CPU.

</para>

<para>

Most ARM CPUs may be run in either endian mode (big or little). However,
the majority of current system implementation uses little-endian mode.
&debian; currently only supports little-endian ARM systems.

The supported platforms are:

<term>IOP32x</term>
<listitem><para>

Intel's I/O Processor (IOP) line is found in a number of products related
to data storage and processing.  &debian; currently supports the IOP32x
platform, featuring the IOP 80219 and 32x chips commonly found in Network
Attached Storage (NAS) devices.  &debian; explicitly supports two such
devices: the <ulink url="&url-arm-cyrius-glantank;">GLAN Tank</ulink> from
IO-Data and the <ulink url="&url-arm-cyrius-n2100;">Thecus N2100</ulink>.

<term>Kirkwood</term>
<listitem><para>

Kirkwood is a system on a chip (SoC) from Marvell that integrates an ARM
CPU, Ethernet, SATA, USB, and other functionality in one chip.  We
currently support the following Kirkwood based devices: OpenRD
(OpenRD-Base, OpenRD-Client and OpenRD-Ultimate), <ulink

GuruPlug)</ulink>, and <ulink url="&url-arm-cyrius-qnap-kirkwood;">QNAP
Turbo Station</ulink> (all TS-11x, TS-21x and TS-41x models).

<listitem><para>

Orion is a system on a chip (SoC) from Marvell that integrates an ARM CPU,
Ethernet, SATA, USB, and other functionality in one chip. There are many
Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices on the market that are based on an
Orion chip. We currently support the following Orion based devices: <ulink

<term>Versatile</term>
<listitem><para>

The Versatile platform is emulated by QEMU and is therefore a nice way to
test and run &debian; on ARM if you don't have the hardware.
