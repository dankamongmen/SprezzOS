 <title>Installing &debian-gnu; &release; For &architecture;</title>
<para>

We are delighted that you have decided to try &debian;, and are
sure that you will find that &debian;'s GNU/&arch-kernel; distribution is
unique. &debian-gnu; brings together high-quality free software
from around the world, integrating it into a coherent whole. We
believe that you will find that the result is truly more than the sum
of the parts.

We understand that many of you want to install &debian; without reading this
manual, and the &debian; installer is designed to make this possible. If you
don't have time to read the whole Installation Guide right now, we recommend
that you read the Installation Howto, which will walk you through the basic
installation process, and links to the manual for more advanced topics or
for when things go wrong. The Installation Howto can be found in
<xref linkend="installation-howto"/>.

With that said, we hope that you have the time to read most of this manual,
and doing so will lead to a more informed and likely more successful
installation experience.
