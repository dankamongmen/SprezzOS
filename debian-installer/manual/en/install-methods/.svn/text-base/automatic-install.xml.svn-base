 <title>Automatic Installation</title>

<classname>fai-quickstart</classname> (which can use an install server) and
the &debian; Installer itself. Have a look at the
<ulink url="http://fai-project.org">FAI home page</ulink> for detailed
information.

The &debian; Installer supports automating installs via preconfiguration
files. A preconfiguration file can be loaded from the network or from
removable media, and used to fill in answers to questions asked during the
installation process.
