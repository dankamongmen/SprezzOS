Hmm. This really does need documenting :-/

- Component is only selected and executed if the installer needs to load
  installer components or the base system from the network
  (either local or the internet).
- This means you first have to configure a network interface.
- Mirror selection is delayed until apt-setup for CD-based installs (except
  businesscard)
- A list of countries is displayed with the default based on the country you
  selected earlier.
- Selection of a local mirror (at top of the list: manual selection).
- After selecting a country, a list of mirrors in the country will be shown.
  (not for ftp)
- Forcing to ftp can be done using "protocol=ftp"
- Note that not all mirrors are equal (see http://www.nl.debian.org/mirror/list)
- cdn.debian.net can be a useful catch-all.

- The selected mirror will be tested.
- How to handle problems with mirrors.
