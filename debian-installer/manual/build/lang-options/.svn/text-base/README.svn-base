INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING OPTIONAL PARAGRAPHS
==========================================

In some places in the manual paragraphs have been included that are not
included in the generated English version of the manual. They can however
be included _optionally_ in translations.

To include an optional paragraph for your translation, you need to "enable"
it:
- creating a file in this directory with your language code as its name
- add a singe line in this file containing:
     optional_paras="condition(s)"
- if you want to enable more than one optional paragraph, separate their
  conditions by a semicolon (without a space)

example
-------
optional_paras="about-langteam;gpl-unofficial"


       *** PLEASE CHECK THE RESULT AFTER THE MANUAL HAS BEEN BUILT ***


TRANSLATING AN OPTIONAL PARAGRAPH
=================================
In some cases you should replace the full text of the paragraph with your own.
In other cases you may need to translate the English text included in the
paragraph.

If comments are included in the paragraph (to help translation), these should
be deleted.


LIST OF DEFINED OPTIONAL PARAGRAPHS
===================================
Currently the following optional paragraphs have been defined (the first term
is the name of the condition used to activate it):
* about-langteam (en/administrativa/administrativa.xml
  Allows to add some info about the translator or translation team, and how
  to contact the translator(s).
* translation-status (en/bookinfo.xml)
  Allows to add information about the status of the translation and maybe to
  request reviews.
* gpl-unofficial (en/appendix/gpl.xml)
  *Must* be included if the GPL itself is translated; should *not* be included
  if the appendix contains the original (untranslated) English text of the GPL.
  Consists of two paragraphs of which the first *should remain in English*.
