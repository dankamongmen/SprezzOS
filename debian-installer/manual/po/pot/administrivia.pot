The DocBook source can be found at the <ulink url=\"&url-d-i-websvn;\">debian-installer WebSVN</ulink>. If you're not familiar with DocBook, don't worry: there is a simple cheatsheet in the manuals directory that will get you started. It's like html, but oriented towards the meaning of the text rather than the presentation. Patches submitted to the debian-boot mailing list (see below) are welcomed. For instructions on how to check out the sources via SVN, see <ulink url=\"&url-d-i-readme;\">README</ulink> from the source root directory."
