msgid "By far the easiest way to install &debian-gnu; is from an Official &debian; CD-ROM Set. You can buy a set from a vendor (see the <ulink url=\"&url-debian-cd-vendors;\">CD vendors page</ulink>). You may also download the CD-ROM images from a &debian; mirror and make your own set, if you have a fast network connection and a CD burner (see the <ulink url=\"&url-debian-cd;\">Debian CD page</ulink> for detailed instructions). If you have a &debian; CD set and CDs are bootable on your machine, you can skip right to <xref linkend=\"boot-installer\"/>; much effort has been expended to ensure the files most people need are there on the CD. Although a full set of binary packages requires several CDs, it is unlikely you will need packages on the third CD and above. You may also consider using the DVD version, which saves a lot of space on your shelf and you avoid the CD shuffling marathon."
