If this was done at a site where the domain is <literal>example.com</literal>, and they have a reasonably sane DHCP setup, it would result in the preseed file being retrieved from <literal>http://autoserver.example.com/d-i/&releasename;/./preseed.cfg</literal>."

The <literal>/./</literal> bit is used to indicate a root, relative to which subsequent paths can be anchored (for use in preseed/include and preseed/run). This allows files to be specified either as full URLs, paths starting with / that are thus anchored, or even paths relative to the location where the last preseed file was found. This can be used to construct more portable scripts where an entire hierarchy of scripts can be moved to a new location without breaking it, for example copying the files onto a USB stick when they started out on a web server. In this example, if the preseed file sets <literal>preseed/run</literal> to <literal>/scripts/late_command.sh</literal> then the file will be fetched from <literal>http://autoserver.example.com/d-i/&releasename;/./scripts/late_command.sh</literal>."

msgid "It is also possible to chainload from the initrd or file preseeding phase, into network preseeding by setting preseed/url in the earlier files. This will cause network preseeding to be performed when the network comes up. You need to be careful when doing this, since there will be two distinct runs at preseeding, meaning for example that you get another chance to run the preseed/early command, the second one happening after the network comes up."
