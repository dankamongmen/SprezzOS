msgid "This installation guide is based on an earlier manual written for the old Debian installation system (the <quote>boot-floppies</quote>), and has been updated to document the new Debian installer. However, for &architecture;, the manual has not been fully updated and fact checked for the new installer. There may remain parts of the manual that are incomplete or outdated or that still document the boot-floppies installer. A newer version of this manual, possibly better documenting this architecture, may be found on the Internet at the <ulink url=\"&url-d-i;\">&d-i; home page</ulink>. You may also be able to find additional translations there."

A newer version of this manual may be found on the Internet at the <ulink url=\"&url-d-i;\">&d-i; home page</ulink>. You may also be able to find additional translations there."
