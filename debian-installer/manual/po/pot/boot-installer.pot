msgid "Some laptop models produced by Dell are known to crash when PCMCIA device detection tries to access some hardware addresses. Other laptops may display similar problems. If you experience such a problem and you don't need PCMCIA support during the installation, you can disable PCMCIA using the <userinput>hw-detect/start_pcmcia=false</userinput> boot parameter. You can then configure PCMCIA after the installation is completed and exclude the resource range causing the problems."

There is also a list of some common resource range options in the <ulink url=\"http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/doc/PCMCIA-HOWTO-1.html#ss1.12\">System resource settings section of the PCMCIA HOWTO</ulink>. Note that you have to omit the commas, if any, when you enter this value in the installer."

Most of these messages are harmless. You see them because the kernel for the installation system is built to run on computers with many different peripheral devices. Obviously, no one computer will have every possible peripheral device, so the operating system may emit a few complaints while it looks for peripherals you don't own. You may also see the system pause for a while. This happens when it is waiting for a device to respond, and that device is not present on your system. If you find the time it takes to boot the system unacceptably long, you can create a custom kernel later <phrase arch=\"linux-any\">(see <xref linkend=\"kernel-baking\"/>)</phrase>."
