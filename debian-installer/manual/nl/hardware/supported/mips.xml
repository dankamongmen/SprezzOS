&debian; on &arch-title; supports the following platforms:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>

SGI IP22: this platform includes the SGI machines Indy, Indigo 2 and
Challenge S.  Since these machines are very similar, whenever this document
refers to the SGI Indy, the Indigo 2 and Challenge S are meant as well.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

SGI IP32: this platform is generally known as SGI O2.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

MIPS Malta: this platform is emulated by QEMU and is therefore a nice way
to test and run &debian; on MIPS if you don't have the hardware.

Complete information regarding supported mips/mipsel machines can be found
at the <ulink url="&url-linux-mips;">Linux-MIPS homepage</ulink>.  In the
following, only the systems supported by the &debian; installer will be
covered.  If you are looking for support for other subarchitectures, please
contact the <ulink url="&url-list-subscribe;">
debian-&arch-listname; mailing list</ulink>.

   <sect3><title>CPU</title>
<para>

On SGI IP22, SGI Indy, Indigo 2 and Challenge S with R4000, R4400, R4600 and R5000
processors are supported by the &debian; installation system on big endian
MIPS.  On SGI IP32, currently only systems based on the R5000 are supported.

</para><para>

Some MIPS machines can be operated in both big and little endian mode.  For
little endian MIPS, please read the documentation for the mipsel
architecture.
