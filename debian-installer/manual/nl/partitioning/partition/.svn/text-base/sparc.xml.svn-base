  <sect2 arch="sparc"><title>Partitioning for &arch-title;</title>
<para>

Make sure you create a <quote>Sun disk label</quote> on your boot disk.  This is
the only kind of partition scheme that the OpenBoot PROM understands,
and so it's the only scheme from which you can boot.  The
<keycap>s</keycap> key is used in <command>fdisk</command> to
create Sun disk labels.

Furthermore, on &arch-title; disks, make sure your first partition on
your boot disk starts at cylinder 0.  While this is required, it also
means that the first partition will contain the partition table and
the boot block, which are the first two sectors of the disk.  You must
<emphasis>not</emphasis> put swap on the first partition of the boot
drive, since swap partitions do not preserve the first few sectors of
the partition.  You can put Ext2 or UFS partitions there; these will
leave the partition table and the boot block alone.

It is also advised that the third partition should be of type <quote>Whole
disk</quote> (type 5), and contain the entire disk (from the first cylinder
to the last).  This is simply a convention of Sun disk labels, and
helps the <command>SILO</command> boot loader keep its bearings.
