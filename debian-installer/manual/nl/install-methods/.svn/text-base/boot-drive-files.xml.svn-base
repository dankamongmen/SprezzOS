 <title>Preparing Files for Hard Disk Booting</title>
<para>

The installer may be booted using boot files placed on an
existing hard drive partition, either launched from another operating
system or by invoking a boot loader directly from the BIOS.

</para><para>

A full, <quote>pure network</quote> installation can be achieved using this
technique. This avoids all hassles of removable media, like finding
and burning CD images or struggling with too numerous and
unreliable floppy disks.

The installer cannot boot from files on an NTFS file system.

</para><para arch="powerpc">

The installer cannot boot from files on an HFS+ file system.  MacOS
System 8.1 and above may use HFS+ file systems; NewWorld PowerMacs all
use HFS+. To determine whether your existing file system is HFS+,
select <userinput>Get Info</userinput> for the volume in question. HFS
file systems appear as <userinput>Mac OS Standard</userinput>, while
HFS+ file systems say <userinput>Mac OS Extended</userinput>. You must
have an HFS partition in order to exchange files between MacOS and
Linux, in particular the installation files you download.

Different programs are used for hard disk installation system booting,
depending on whether the system is a <quote>NewWorld</quote> or an
<quote>OldWorld</quote> model.

  <title>Hard disk installer booting using <command>LILO</command> or

This section explains how to add to or even replace an existing linux
installation using either <command>LILO</command> or
<command>GRUB</command>.

At boot time, both bootloaders support loading in memory not
only the kernel, but also a disk image. This RAM disk can be used as
the root file-system by the kernel.

Copy the following files from the &debian; archives to a
convenient location on your hard drive, for instance to
<filename>/boot/newinstall/</filename>.

Finally, to configure the bootloader proceed to

  <title>Hard Disk Installer Booting for OldWorld Macs</title>
<para>

The <filename>boot-floppy-hfs</filename> floppy uses
<application>miBoot</application> to launch Linux installation, but
<application>miBoot</application> cannot easily be used for hard disk
booting. <application>BootX</application>, launched from MacOS,
supports booting from files placed on the hard
disk. <application>BootX</application> can also be used to dual-boot
MacOS and Linux after your &debian; installation is complete. For the
Performa 6360, it appears that <command>quik</command> cannot make the
hard disk bootable.  So <application>BootX</application> is required
on that model.

</para><para>

Download and unstuff the <application>BootX</application>
distribution, available from <ulink url="&url-powerpc-bootx;"></ulink>,
or in the
<filename>dists/woody/main/disks-powerpc/current/powermac</filename>
directory on &debian; http/ftp mirrors and official &debian; CDs. Use
<application>Stuffit Expander</application> to extract it from its
archive. Within the package, there is an empty folder called
<filename>Linux Kernels</filename>. Download
<filename>linux.bin</filename> and
<filename>ramdisk.image.gz</filename> from the
<filename>disks-powerpc/current/powermac</filename> folder, and place
them in the <filename>Linux Kernels</filename> folder. Then place the
<filename>Linux Kernels</filename> folder in the active System Folder.

<para>

NewWorld PowerMacs support booting from a network or an ISO9660
CD-ROM, as well as loading ELF binaries directly from the hard
disk. These machines will boot Linux directly via
<command>yaboot</command>, which supports loading a kernel and RAMdisk
directly from an ext2 partition, as well as dual-booting with
MacOS. Hard disk booting of the installer is particularly appropriate
for newer machines without floppy drives. <command>BootX</command> is
not supported and must not be used on NewWorld PowerMacs.

Make a note of the partition number of the MacOS partition where you
place these files. If you have the MacOS <command>pdisk</command>
program, you can use the <command>L</command> command to check for the
partition number. You will need this partition number for the command
you type at the Open Firmware prompt when you boot the installer.
