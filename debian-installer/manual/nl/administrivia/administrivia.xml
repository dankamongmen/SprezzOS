 <title>About This Document</title>

<para>

This manual was created for Sarge's debian-installer, based on
the Woody installation manual for boot-floppies, which was based
on earlier Debian installation manuals, and on the Progeny
distribution manual which was released under GPL in 2003.

This document is written in DocBook XML.  Output formats are generated
by various programs using information from the
<classname>docbook-xml</classname> and
<classname>docbook-xsl</classname> packages.

In order to increase the maintainability of this document, we use
a number of XML features, such as entities and profiling attributes.
These play a role akin to variables and conditionals in programming
languages.  The XML source to this document contains information for
each different architecture &mdash; profiling attributes are used to
isolate certain bits of text as architecture-specific.

translators and reviewers from the translation team for {your language}
at {your l10n mailinglist}".

See build/lang-options/README on how to enable this paragraph.
Its condition is "about-langteam".

Better yet, get a copy of the DocBook source for this document, and
produce patches against it.  The DocBook source can be found at the
<ulink url="&url-d-i-websvn;">debian-installer WebSVN</ulink>. If
you're not familiar with DocBook, don't worry:
there is a simple cheatsheet in the manuals directory that will get
you started. It's like html, but oriented towards the meaning of
the text rather than the presentation. Patches submitted to the
debian-boot mailing list (see below) are welcomed.

<ulink url="&url-d-i-readme;">README</ulink>
