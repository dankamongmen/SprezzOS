&boot-installer-intro-cd.xml;

<para>

Currently, the only &arch-title; subarchitectures that support CD-ROM
booting are PReP (though not all systems) and New World PowerMacs.
On PowerMacs, hold the <keycap>c</keycap> key, or else the combination of
<keycap>Command</keycap>, <keycap>Option</keycap>,
<keycap>Shift</keycap>, and <keycap>Delete</keycap>
keys together while booting to boot from the CD-ROM.

</para><para>

OldWorld PowerMacs will not boot a &debian; CD, because OldWorld
computers relied on a Mac OS ROM CD boot driver to be present on the CD,
and a free-software version of this driver is not available. All
OldWorld systems have floppy drives, so use the floppy drive to launch
the installer, and then point the installer to the CD for the needed
files.

</para><para>

If your system doesn't boot directly from CD-ROM, you can still use
the CD-ROM to install the system. On NewWorlds, you can also use an
OpenFirmware command to boot from the CD-ROM manually. Follow the
instructions in <xref linkend="boot-newworld"/> for booting from
the hard disk, except use the path to <command>yaboot</command> on the
CD at the OF prompt, such as

<informalexample><screen>
0 &gt; boot cd:,\install\yaboot
</screen></informalexample>

<para>

If you set up BootX in <xref linkend="files-oldworld"/>, you can
use it to boot into the installation system. Double click the
<guiicon>BootX</guiicon> application icon. Click on the
<guibutton>Options</guibutton> button and select <guilabel>Use
Specified RAM Disk</guilabel>. This will give you the
chance to select the <filename>ramdisk.image.gz</filename> file. You
may need to select the <guilabel>No Video Driver</guilabel> checkbox,
depending on your hardware. Then click the
<guibutton>Linux</guibutton> button to shut down MacOS and launch the
installer.

  <title>Booting NewWorld Macs from OpenFirmware</title>
<para>

You will have already placed the <filename>vmlinux</filename>,
<filename>initrd.gz</filename>, <filename>yaboot</filename>, and
<filename>yaboot.conf</filename> files at the root level of your HFS
partition in <xref linkend="files-newworld"/>.
You will now have to boot into OpenFirmware (see <xref linkend="invoking-openfirmware"/>).
At the prompt, type

<informalexample><screen>
0 &gt; boot hd:<replaceable>x</replaceable>,yaboot
</screen></informalexample>

replacing <replaceable>x</replaceable> with the partition number of
the HFS partition where the
kernel and yaboot files were placed, followed by a &enterkey;. On some
machines, you may need to use <userinput>ide0:</userinput> instead of
<userinput>hd:</userinput>. In a few more seconds you will see a
yaboot prompt

<informalexample><screen>
boot:
</screen></informalexample>

At yaboot's <prompt>boot:</prompt> prompt, type either
<userinput>install</userinput> or <userinput>install video=ofonly</userinput>
followed by a &enterkey;.  The
<userinput>video=ofonly</userinput> argument is for maximum
compatibility; you can try it if <userinput>install</userinput>
doesn't work. The &debian; installation program should start.

  <sect2 arch="powerpc" condition="bootable-usb" id="usb-boot">
  <title>Booting from USB memory stick</title>
<para>

Currently, NewWorld PowerMac systems are known to support USB booting.

</para>

<para>

Make sure you have prepared everything from <xref
linkend="boot-usb-files"/>. To boot a Macintosh system from a USB stick,
you will need to use the Open Firmware prompt, since Open Firmware does
not search USB storage devices by default.
<!-- TODO: although it could be made to; watch this space -->
See <xref linkend="invoking-openfirmware"/>.

</para><para>

You will need to work out where the USB storage device appears in the
device tree, since at the moment <command>ofpath</command> cannot work
that out automatically. Type <userinput>dev / ls</userinput> and
<userinput>devalias</userinput> at the Open Firmware prompt to get a
list of all known devices and device aliases. On the author's system
with various types of USB stick, paths such as
<filename>usb0/disk</filename>, <filename>usb0/hub/disk</filename>,
<filename>/pci@f2000000/usb@1b,1/disk@1</filename>, and
<filename>/pci@f2000000/usb@1b,1/hub@1/disk@1</filename> work.

</para><para>

Having worked out the device path, use a command like this to boot the
installer:

<informalexample><screen>
boot <replaceable>usb0/disk</replaceable>:<replaceable>2</replaceable>,\\:tbxi
</screen></informalexample>

The <replaceable>2</replaceable> matches the Apple_HFS or
Apple_Bootstrap partition onto which you copied the boot image earlier,
and the <userinput>,\\:tbxi</userinput> part instructs Open Firmware to
boot from the file with an HFS file type of "tbxi" (i.e.
<command>yaboot</command>) in the directory previously blessed with
<command>hattrib -b</command>.

</para><para>

The system should now boot up, and you should be presented with the
<prompt>boot:</prompt> prompt. Here you can enter optional boot
arguments, or just hit &enterkey;.

</para><warning><para>

This boot method is new, and may be difficult to get to work on some
NewWorld systems. If you have problems, please file an installation
report, as explained in <xref linkend="submit-bug"/>.

  <sect2 arch="powerpc" id="boot-tftp"><title>Booting with TFTP</title>

&boot-installer-intro-net.xml;

<para>

Currently, PReP and New World PowerMac systems support netbooting.

</para><para>

On machines with Open Firmware, such as NewWorld Power Macs, enter the
boot monitor (see <xref linkend="invoking-openfirmware"/>) and
use the command

<informalexample><screen>
0 &gt; boot enet:0
</screen></informalexample>

If this doesn't work, you might have to add the filename like this:

<informalexample><screen>
0 &gt; boot enet:0,yaboot
</screen></informalexample>

PReP and CHRP boxes
may have different ways of addressing the network.  On a PReP machine,
you should try

<informalexample><screen>
boot net:<replaceable>server_ipaddr</replaceable>,<replaceable>file</replaceable>,<replaceable>client_ipaddr</replaceable>
</screen></informalexample>

On some PReP systems (e.g. Motorola PowerStack machines) the command
<userinput>help boot</userinput> may give a description of syntax and
available options.

  <title>Booting from Floppies</title>
<para>

Booting from floppies is supported for &arch-title;, although it is
generally only applicable for OldWorld systems. NewWorld systems are
not equipped with floppy drives, and attached USB floppy drives are
not supported for booting.

</para><para>

You will have already downloaded the floppy images you needed and
created floppies from the images in <xref linkend="create-floppy"/>.

</para><para>

To boot from the <filename>boot-floppy-hfs.img</filename> floppy,
place it in floppy drive after shutting the system down, and before
pressing the power-on button.

</para><note><para>
For those not familiar with Macintosh
floppy operations: a floppy placed in the machine prior to boot will
be the first priority for the system to boot from. A floppy without a
valid boot system will be ejected, and the machine will then check for
bootable hard disk partitions.

</para></note><para>

After booting, the <filename>root.bin</filename> floppy is
requested. Insert the root floppy and press &enterkey;. The installer
program is automatically launched after the root system has been
loaded into memory.

<para>

Many older Apple monitors used a 640x480 67Hz mode. If your video
appears skewed on an older Apple monitor, try appending the boot
argument <userinput>video=atyfb:vmode:6</userinput> , which will
select that mode for most Mach64 and Rage video hardware. For Rage 128
hardware, this changes to
<userinput>video=aty128fb:vmode:6</userinput> .
