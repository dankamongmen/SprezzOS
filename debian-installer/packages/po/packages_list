# List of packages with translatable material
# which we want translators to work on
#
# ONLY i18n COORDINATORS or release managers should add packages here
#
# Developers, if your package has translatable material and
# is not listed here, please get in touch with the i18n coordinators
# and request for it to be added
#
# These packages are sorted by order of "importance". This is the order
# which will be used in master PO files
#
# The full path of the package root (relative to packages/) must
# be used here. DO NOT USE THE SOURCE PACKAGE NAME.

# To exclude a package from the translation statistics that trigger the
# display of warnings for incomplete translations, add a "-" after the
# package name. See also: scripts/l10n/calc-release-status.
