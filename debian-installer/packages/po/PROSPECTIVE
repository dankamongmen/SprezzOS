# The languages listed here are "prospective"
# The translations contained in PO files will NOT
# be spread over the packages
#
# This is meant for getting more control about which
# languages are included in a release
#
# Languages without supported locales in Debian should
# stay here until at least one locale really exists
#
# For translators names and addresses, see
