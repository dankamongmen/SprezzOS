Max,

Good news. We have Broadcom Corporate and Legal approval for release of our
firmware as part of the BlueZ posting. Send us a copy of it to load up when
you have a chance (or let us know when its up and we will download it).

The BCM_LEGAL.txt file should contain the following information:

- - - - - -

BCM firmware version 2.9
Copyright (c) 2000-2001 Broadcom Corporation

Contact info:
         bluetooth_help@broadcom.com

BlueFW will have:
         BCM2033_md.hex  -       BCM mini driver
         BCM2033_fw.bin  -       BCM firmware
         BCM.LEGAL.txt   -       Legal info

- - - - - -

We are going to make another release of firmware in about 2 weeks and will
definitely keep you in the loop.

Regards,

Craig
